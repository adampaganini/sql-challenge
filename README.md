Various SQL commands are logged in the file queries.sql for queries searching various csv tables stored in the ["EmployeeSQL_csv_files"](https://github.com/adampaganini/sql-challenge/tree/main/EmployeeSQL_csv_files) folder in this repo.  The tables were importewd into PGAdmin using an import script devised from a DB diagram created with Quick DB. [Screenshots of the Quick DBD](https://github.com/adampaganini/sql-challenge/blob/main/Quick_DBD_Screenshot%202023-02-12%20at%201.59.55%20PM.png) are stored here as well.

The data analysis was done by creating a [query file](https://github.com/adampaganini/sql-challenge/blob/main/queries.sql) that contains the following list of query commands:

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
